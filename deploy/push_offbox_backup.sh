# Off-box backup PUSH -- runs ON THE DROPLET, uploads a compressed snapshot
# of the live database to an S3-compatible bucket.
#
# This replaces pull_droplet_backup.sh, which ran on a laptop. That design
# failed on 2026-09-30: the laptop's launchd agent could not execute the
# script (macOS TCC, repo lived in ~/Downloads) and the failure was visible
# only in a local log nobody reads, so the off-box copy silently stopped for
# two days during an unattended run. The lessons encoded here:
#   - the host that owns the data owns the backup (no second machine to fail)
#   - EVERY failure path alerts; silence must mean success, not "unknown"
#   - never let the backup itself be the thing that fills the disk
#
# Install: see deploy/README.md. Config lives in /etc/kalshi-offbox.env
# (credentials -- not in git).
